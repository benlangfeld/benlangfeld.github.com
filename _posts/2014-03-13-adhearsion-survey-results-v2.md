In January, we put together the second round of the Adhearsion Community Survey to gather data on how Adhearsion is being used in the wild, and what factors are important to the people and projects using it. <img src="http://mojolingo.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/6035506731_fcf1d99c80_o-300x182.jpg" alt="Image Courtesy Mark Hillary http://www.flickr.com/photos/markhillary/" width="300" height="182" class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1423" /> This survey closed on Friday 28th February, and we've got the results for you right here in full (minus identifying information) to browse through. Below please find our high-level takeaways from the survey responses that we are now using to process our next steps in Adhearsion and to consider the content for RatchetConf (stay tuned):

* [Internationalisation support](https://github.com/adhearsion/adhearsion/issues/361) is now more important than it was last year. We've listened to this and started work on [adhearsion-i18n](https://github.com/adhearsion/adhearsion-i18n). This plugin is in early development, but will hopefully mature quickly, especially with community use.
* Satisfaction with our documentation has increased drastically since last year
* Respondents now consider the supportive community, quantity of features, API clarity and performance to be a stronger aspects of the Adhearsion project
* Deployments on Asterisk and FreeSWITCH are now almost even, but deployments on Voxeo PRISM have now dropped off the map
* People deploying to Asterisk are now overwhelmingly using Asterisk 11, while deployments on Asterisk <= 1.8 are all but gone (yay!)
* Most people have upgraded from Ruby 1.8 to Ruby 1.9.3 (this means Adhearsion 1 applications going away), but fewer people are deploying to JRuby than last year
* Average call volume on Adhearsion applications is up, with one respondent reportedly processing over 100k calls per day!
* Most respondents consider themselves to be primarily Ruby developers, rather than telephony or web developers

This data will help to inform our decision making about the future of Adhearsion, through the rest of the 2.x series and on to 3.0.
