# Open Source
Eventually this page will contain links to most of the open source projects I've worked on.

## Voice
[Adhearsion](http://adhearsion.com)
: Adhearsion is a fully featured voice application framework, similar to Rails for web apps. I'm on the core Adhearsion team, and I'm working on lots of exciting stuff for the project.

[Punchblock](http://adhearsion.github.com/punchblock)
: Punchblock is a middleware library designed to abstract the complexities of using various VoIP engines (Rayo, Asterisk, FreeSWITCH etc) for third-party call control. I wrote the vast majority of the code in the Punchblock library

## Other
[StropheCappuccino](https://github.com/benlangfeld/StropheCappuccino)

[CappuccinoTalk](https://github.com/benlangfeld/CappuccinoTalk)
: CappuccinoTalk is a Jabber/XMPP client built using the Cappuccino framework. It uses StropheCappuccino. It's nowhere near finished, but it was fun to start. Maybe someone will continue with it some day.

## Interests
[Celluloid](http://celluloid.io)
: Celluloid is a concurrent object oriented programming framework for Ruby which lets you build multithreaded programs out of concurrent objects just as easily as you build sequential programs out of regular objects.

I have contributed a few small fixed to Celluloid, and use it in various projects, both public and private. If you want painless concurrent programming in Ruby, look at Celluloid and the actor model in general.

[CloudFoundry](http://cloudfoundry.org)
: The Open Platform as a Service Project. CloudFoundry is PaaS in the same vain as Heroku, including features similar to classic Heroku, as well as Cedar.
